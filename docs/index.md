# Abstract

The Lottie Animation Format is a vector format focused on animation,
interaction, real-time updates and multi-platform support. This document
describes the specifications of the format and its extensibility. It will also
describe how to specify supported layer types and properties.

Given its objective of being a global animation vector format, the Lottie
Animation Format does not focus on performance improvements for a single
platform. Instead it tries to be as simple and extendable as possible.

The format is influenced by the Adobe After Effects Render Model, from which it
draws the layer, keyframes, and properties structure.

This specification defines a model for drawing and animating a set of layers on
a canvas.
