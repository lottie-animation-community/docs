# Scope

The scope of this Working Group is to specify the format of the Lottie Animation Format, both 
the allowed JSON structure, the semantics of that structure, and how such Lottie files are to be 
rendered. The definition of the correct rendering will be specified by a combination of verbiage 
in the written specification and by exemplar Lottie files and their desired renderings committed
to the [`tests`](https://github.com/lottie-animation-community/tests) repo.
